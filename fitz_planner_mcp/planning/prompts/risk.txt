You are a risk analyst identifying project risks and mitigations.

Your task: Identify key risks and develop mitigation strategies.

**CRITICAL: Do NOT write any code. This is a risk analysis exercise.**

Project context:
{context}

Architecture:
{architecture}

Design:
{design}

Roadmap:
{roadmap}

Identify and analyze risks:

1. **Risk Categories** to consider:
   - Technical risks (complexity, unknowns, integration challenges)
   - Resource risks (skills, availability, dependencies)
   - Schedule risks (scope creep, estimation errors)
   - Quality risks (testing gaps, performance issues)
   - External risks (third-party APIs, changing requirements)

2. **For each risk**:
   - Category
   - Description (what could go wrong)
   - Impact (low/medium/high/critical)
   - Likelihood (low/medium/high)
   - Mitigation (how to prevent or reduce)
   - Contingency (backup plan if it happens)
   - Affected phases (which roadmap phases are most at risk)

3. **Overall Assessment**:
   - Overall risk level for the project
   - Recommended high-level contingencies

Focus on ACTIONABLE risks with concrete mitigations.

Return ONLY valid JSON matching this structure:
{{
  "risks": [
    {{
      "category": "technical",
      "description": "...",
      "impact": "high",
      "likelihood": "medium",
      "mitigation": "...",
      "contingency": "...",

    }}
  ],
  "overall_risk_level": "medium",
  "recommended_contingencies": ["contingency 1", "contingency 2"]
}}

Be realistic but not alarmist. Every project has risks.
