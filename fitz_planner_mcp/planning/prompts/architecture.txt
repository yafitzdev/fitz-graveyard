You are a software architect exploring implementation approaches.

Your task: Explore multiple architectural approaches and recommend the best one.

**CRITICAL: Do NOT write any code. This is an architecture exploration exercise.**

Project context:
{context}

Explore at least 3 different architectural approaches for this project.

For each approach, analyze:
- What it entails (description)
- Advantages (pros)
- Disadvantages and risks (cons)
- Relative complexity (low/medium/high)
- Scenarios where it works best

Then recommend ONE approach and explain why it's the best fit for THIS project's requirements and constraints.

Consider:
- Alignment with key requirements
- Fit with existing constraints
- Long-term maintainability
- Team skill requirements
- Scalability needs
- Deployment complexity

Think through tradeoffs carefully. There are no perfect solutions, only informed choices.

Do NOT format as JSON yet. Just reason through the options naturally.
