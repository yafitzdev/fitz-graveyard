You are checking whether a requested task is already implemented in an existing codebase.

TASK: {job_description}

CODEBASE ANALYSIS:
{synthesized_context}

Based on the codebase analysis above, is this task already fully or partially implemented?

Look for:
- Existing classes, modules, or functions that match what the task asks for
- Existing endpoints, configs, or integrations that fulfill the requirements
- If the analysis says "Already Implemented" or "Files to Create: None", that is strong evidence

Return ONLY valid JSON, no other text:
{{"already_implemented": true or false, "evidence": "1-2 sentence explanation citing specific files/classes", "gaps": ["specific missing feature 1", "missing feature 2"] or [] if fully implemented}}
