You are evaluating architectural approaches for this project. Take a strong, opinionated position.

{krag_context}

Project context:
{context}

Explore exactly 3 architectural approaches. For each:
- What does it look like in production? Name specific services, libraries, and patterns.
- What is the most common failure mode for teams that take this approach?
- What operational burden does it add?
- What does it make easy that the other approaches make hard?

Then take a clear position: which approach is right for THIS project and why. Do not hedge. Specifically explain why the other two approaches would be wrong here — not just "more complex" but what specific failure mode or risk makes them the wrong choice given these requirements and constraints.

A senior engineer who has shipped production systems like this one would choose which approach, and why would the other two be mistakes?
