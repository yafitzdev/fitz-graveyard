Identify the real risks — not textbook categories, but the things that would actually derail this specific project.

SCOPE RULE: Every risk you list must be directly caused by a decision made in this plan. If a risk would exist whether or not this feature was built, cut it. Do not list risks about other parts of the system, general operational concerns, or things outside the scope of these roadmap phases.

1. Technical bets: This plan makes assumptions that could prove false. What are the 2-3 most critical ones specific to what was just designed? What happens to the timeline and design if each one is wrong?

2. Non-obvious risks: What would an experienced engineer immediately flag that a junior one would miss? These must be specific to the approach chosen — not generic engineering concerns.

3. Integration failures: Which external systems or APIs does THIS feature specifically bet on? What is the blast radius if they change behavior?

4. Silent failure modes: Where could this feature fail in a way that produces no error — just wrong output? These are the most dangerous because no one notices until production.

5. Security attack surface introduced by this change: What new attack surface does this feature specifically add? If the feature adds no new attack surface, say so explicitly rather than inventing one.

Be specific. Generic risks like "scope creep" or risks about unrelated system components are useless and will be cut.
