Identify the real risks — not textbook categories, but the things that would actually derail this specific project:

1. Technical bets: This project makes assumptions that could prove false. What are the 2-3 most critical ones? What happens to timeline and design if each one is wrong?

2. Non-obvious risks: What would an experienced engineer immediately flag that a junior one would miss? These are often the most dangerous because no one plans for them.

3. Integration failures: Which external systems or APIs is this project betting on? What is the blast radius if they change behavior, go down, or become cost-prohibitive?

4. Knowledge concentration: What skills or knowledge are on the critical path? What breaks if the one person who understands X is unavailable?

5. Security attack surface: What is the most realistic attack vector? What data, if exfiltrated, causes the most damage?

6. Schedule reality: Which phases are underestimated? What does an 80th percentile timeline look like vs. the optimistic estimate?

Be specific. Generic risks like "scope creep" are useless. Name specific risks for this project with concrete impact assessments.
