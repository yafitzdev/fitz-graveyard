Briefly review this project planning request and identify what's underspecified.

Request: {description}

Identify 2-3 focused questions whose answers would most change the plan. Only ask questions where the answer would meaningfully change the architecture, scope, or approach — don't ask about things that can be reasonably assumed.

Good questions uncover: real scope boundaries, hidden constraints, tech stack decisions that affect architecture, or key user journeys that change the design.

Return ONLY a JSON array of 2-3 question strings:
["question 1", "question 2"]

If the description is already specific enough, return: []
