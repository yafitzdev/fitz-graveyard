You have read the project codebase and are now reviewing a planning request to identify what's underspecified.

Project request: {description}

{codebase_context}

Based on what you know about the existing project and the request, identify 2-3 targeted questions whose answers would most change the architecture or scope of the plan. Only ask questions where the answer would meaningfully change decisions — don't ask about things already clear from the codebase or the description.

Good questions uncover: scope boundaries that aren't obvious, constraints that affect architecture, integration points that change the design, or user journeys that determine the component structure.

Return ONLY a JSON array of 2-3 question strings:
["question 1", "question 2"]

If the description is already specific enough given what you know about the project, return: []
