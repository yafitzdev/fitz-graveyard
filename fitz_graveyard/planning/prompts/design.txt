You are making concrete design decisions for this project.

Project context:
{context}

Architecture decision:
{architecture}

Think through the design carefully:

1. Critical decisions: What are the 3-5 decisions where choosing wrong would require significant rework? For each: what is the wrong choice that looks reasonable, what is the right choice, and specifically why?

2. Component boundaries: Where exactly do the system boundaries go? What is the strict interface contract between components? What must not cross a boundary?

3. Data model: What are the core entities? What are the exact relationships and cardinality? What query patterns must this support efficiently? What would be expensive to change later?

4. Integration complexity: Which external dependencies will be harder than expected? What specific failure modes — not just "handle errors" — need explicit design?

Be concrete. Interfaces should look like real function or method signatures. Data model should have actual field names and types. Avoid "TBD" — make a decision and defend it.
