You are reviewing a project planning request to understand what is actually being built.

Request: {description}

{krag_context}

Think through this carefully:

1. What is the core thing being built? What problem does it solve, for whom, and in what context?

2. What requirements are stated explicitly? What requirements are implied but not stated? Label which are stated facts vs. your assumptions.

3. What constraints are real and binding vs. aspirational? (e.g. "must handle 10k concurrent users" is a constraint; "should be fast" is not)

4. What is genuinely unclear or ambiguous in this description? Name specific tensions or gaps.

5. What is in scope for an MVP? What sounds related but is probably out of scope for a first version?

6. Who are the real stakeholders and what do they specifically care about — not job titles, but concrete concerns?

7. Existing files: These are files that ALREADY EXIST in the codebase. For each, briefly note what it does and why it matters to this task. List only files that will be read, modified, or whose contracts matter. If no codebase context was provided, say so.

8. Needed artifacts: What files must be CREATED that don't exist yet? These are your concrete deliverables. Name exact filenames and what each one does. If the deliverable IS a single file, say so — the project scope is that file. Do NOT list existing files here.

9. Assumptions: For every gap or ambiguity above, state your assumption explicitly.
   For each: what did you assume, what changes if you're wrong, and how confident are you (low/medium/high)?
   This is critical — the user needs to see what you guessed so they can correct it.

Be specific. If the description is vague, say so and state what you are assuming. Do not produce generic planning boilerplate.
