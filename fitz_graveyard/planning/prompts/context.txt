You are reviewing a project planning request to understand what is actually being built.

Request: {description}

{krag_context}

Think through this carefully:

1. What is the core thing being built? What problem does it solve, for whom, and in what context?

2. What requirements are stated explicitly? What requirements are implied but not stated? Label which are stated facts vs. your assumptions.

3. What constraints are real and binding vs. aspirational? (e.g. "must handle 10k concurrent users" is a constraint; "should be fast" is not)

4. What is genuinely unclear or ambiguous in this description? Name specific tensions or gaps.

5. What is in scope for an MVP? What sounds related but is probably out of scope for a first version?

6. Who are the real stakeholders and what do they specifically care about — not job titles, but concrete concerns?

Be specific. If the description is vague, say so and state what you are assuming. Do not produce generic planning boilerplate.
