You are a codebase analyst selecting files for architectural review.

TASK: {job_description}

Below is a STRUCTURAL INDEX of the entire project. For each file you can see:
- Classes (with base classes and method names)
- Functions (with parameter names)
- Imports (which modules each file depends on)
- Config keys, headings, or type definitions

Use this information to identify which files are most relevant to the task.

STRUCTURAL INDEX:
{structural_index}

SELECTION CRITERIA (in priority order):
1. Files that implement or define the feature/component mentioned in the task
2. Files that the task's target files import from or depend on (base classes, protocols, schemas)
3. Config/schema files that define extension points relevant to the task
4. Factory/registry files that wire components together
5. Entry points only if the task involves CLI or API changes
6. Exclude test files UNLESS the task is specifically about testing

REASONING PROCESS:
- Look at class hierarchies: which classes implement relevant protocols/interfaces?
- Follow imports: which files are imported by the most task-relevant files?
- Check function signatures: which functions handle the operations mentioned in the task?
- Look for factory/dispatch patterns that wire the relevant components together

Select at most {max_files} files. Return ONLY a JSON array of relative file paths, no explanation:
["path/to/file1.py", "path/to/file2.py"]
