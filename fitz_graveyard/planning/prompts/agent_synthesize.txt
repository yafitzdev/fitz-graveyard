You are a codebase analyst. Combine these file summaries into a structured context document for an architectural planner.

TASK: {job_description}

FILE SUMMARIES:
{summaries}

Produce a markdown document with these sections:

## Project Overview
What the project is, its purpose, and high-level architecture.

## Relevant Architecture
Module structure, layer boundaries, and patterns relevant to the task.

## Key Interfaces & Contracts
Exact function signatures, class interfaces, field names, and data structures
that the planner must know about. Use exact names from the summaries.

## Existing Patterns
Coding conventions, abstractions, and design patterns found in the codebase.

## Already Implemented
Does the codebase already contain code that fully or partially solves this task?
Look for existing classes, functions, modules, or endpoints that match what the
task is asking for. If the task says "build X" but X already exists, say so
explicitly and describe what exists. This is the most important section — building
something that already exists is the worst possible outcome.

## Files That Will Change
Which existing files are likely affected by the task and why.

## Files to Create
New files that may need to be created, based on project conventions.
If the task is already implemented, this section should say "None — see Already Implemented above."

RULES:
- Do NOT invent information not present in the summaries above.
- Use exact identifiers, field names, and signatures from the summaries.
- Be concise but thorough. The planner depends on this document for accuracy.
