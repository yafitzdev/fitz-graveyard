You are a codebase analyst. Combine these file summaries into a structured context document for an architectural planner.

TASK: {job_description}

FILE SUMMARIES:
{summaries}

Produce a markdown document with these sections:

## Project Overview
What the project is, its purpose, and high-level architecture.

## Relevant Architecture
Module structure, layer boundaries, and patterns relevant to the task.

## Key Interfaces & Contracts
Exact function signatures, class interfaces, field names, and data structures
that the planner must know about. Use exact names from the summaries.

## Existing Patterns
Coding conventions, abstractions, and design patterns found in the codebase.

## Files That Will Change
Which existing files are likely affected by the task and why.

## Files to Create
New files that may need to be created, based on project conventions.

RULES:
- Do NOT invent information not present in the summaries above.
- Use exact identifiers, field names, and signatures from the summaries.
- Be concise but thorough. The planner depends on this document for accuracy.
