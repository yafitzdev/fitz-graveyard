Think through the actual implementation sequence:

1. True MVP: What is the minimum that proves the core value and could be shown to a stakeholder? Be ruthless — what can be cut from v1 without losing the core value proposition?

2. Real dependencies: Which phases genuinely cannot start until another completes because they depend on its output? Which "dependencies" are just ordering preferences?

3. Risk sequencing: What should be built first to reduce technical uncertainty — not what is easiest, but what would invalidate the plan if it turns out to be harder than expected?

4. Underestimated phases: Which phases look simple but hide significant complexity, and why?

5. Concrete deliverables: What would someone see, test, or demo at the end of each phase? Not "implement X module" — what working behavior does it produce?

4-7 phases is usually right. Design for incremental delivery, not a textbook waterfall.
